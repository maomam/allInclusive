              people
              who experience stress and axiety as a result of trauma. The principles are based on findings from the
              field of

              of trauma informed care into the design and construction of the spaces where care takes place.</p>
            <p class="introText">My goal was to transform these findings and formulate the principles for the digital

        <p class="subtitle">While accessibility is a big topic in design, it is often understood in terms of insuring
          the physical accessibility or removing the existing barriers to make the products available to the wide range
          of users. My goal was to research the ways to make digital products more accessible to people who experience stress and anxiety as a result of trauma. 
          The research showed that there is way more studies and sources in the
          domain of architecture and interior design then from the field of human-computer interaction. This platform is
          intended to share experience, gather knowledge and provide practical examples in trauma-informed design in the digital world.</p>

        <h2>Natural and cool colors </h2>
        <p> Colors of your product communicate certain mood and affect emotions of users. Longer-wavelength colors
          like red are experienced as arousing, and shorter-wavelength colors like green are experienced as calming.  Light, cool and less
          saturated colors can be used to create a calming, safe and open feeling. Carefully consider the usage of hued
          warm colors that may arouse negative emotions. Also it is important to cinsider <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/"> culture-specific </a> associations too colors depending on the target audience.</p>
        <p> An important aspect about choosing appropriate colors is the <a
            href="https://colorandcontrast.com/#/">contrast</a> between the elements. There APCA algorithm can be used
          to check the contrast for colors used in the interface. APCA takes into account various aspects of contrast &
          color perception, such as spatial frequency, simultaneous contrast, and elements of light & dark adaptation. Regardless of how light or dark the two colors are, a contrast value of Lc 60 represents the same perceived readability contrast. The APCA has a set of levels related to use cases â€” for instance, Lc 90 is preferred and Lc 75 is the minimum for body text.

        <h2>Power and control</h2>
        <p> The usage of digital products can provoke an overwhelming sense of powerlessness to many people, especially
          those experiencing stress and anxiety. The usage of <a
            href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">dark
            patterns</a> in design (techniques which are used to manipulate or decieve the users into making actions
          against their will) facilitates the feeling of having no control. It is very important to be aware of these
          patters to achieve transparency and help users to remain in control.</p>
          <p> One of these techniques contributing to anxiety is the sence of fake urgency, which is imposed onto the user.
          Timeouts, time counters or an artificial sence of scarcity and urgency for performing certain actions can
          cause a lot of unease and axiety. There are some efforts for <a href=" 
          https://caseorganic.medium.com/is-your-product-designed-to-be-calm-cdde5039cca5"> "calm technology"</a> meaning that the technology is
          designed to unobtrusively interact with users with respect to their attention. Some types of deceptive pattern
          are already illegal in many countries and there is a lot of research being done legal cases imposed to
          organisations using these patters.

        <h2>Font legibility</h2>
        <p> The main purpose of the font is to ensure text readybility. Please consider legibility as the main factor while
          choosing typefaces. Legibility and clarity is definetely <a href="https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-ui-typeface-goes-unnoticed"> more important </a> then personality or creativity. </p>
        <p>There are a lot of <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2015/03/typefaces-for-dyslexia.html"> studies and
            discussions </a> about using special fonts designed for people with dyslexia. The conclusion should be made that
          custom fonts themselves are considered not helpful for people with leaning particularities. Still, many effort were made to create a typeface focusing on letterform distinction to increase character recognition for low-vision users. These considerations can be taken into account when choosing a typeface. </p>
        <p>Althouth a legible font contributes to more comprehension, other typograhic means are considered to contribute to
          reading speed or accuracy more. To create an accessible content, many typografic considerations about <a href="https://medium.com/@nitishkmrk/legibility-in-user-interfaces-2e6b26db1c26">layout, balance, positioning, hierarchy and structure </a> should be made.

        <p> One of the factors <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/inclusive-ux-in-an-era-of-anxiety-dc89c39ec202"> causing axiety</a> is fear of making mistakes or stress after making a mistake. When working on texts, use empowering and positive language. Show your users that you belive that they are able to succed in using your product. It is important to set expectations and be transparent about the function of your product from the beginning and provide indication of progress for the essential processes, supporting users on their way. Also explain why certain data is collected and only request information you absolutely need to reduce anxiety about having to reveal too much personal data.
        </p>
        <p> Special care should be taken while writing error messages. Prepare for both system failure and human error, and respond to each with the same level of clarity. In case of a human error, it is important to provide clear instructions for the options and next steps.

        <h2>Accessible Media files </h2>
        <p> Put the user in control when you use animation, audio or video. Autoplay videos and audios prevent users from making a conscious choice. A better alternative is to require an
          explicit action to put users in control and prevent harmful binge watching.
          Users may feel very unease when experiencing sudden sound or movement. Too much motion or visual elements quickly distract users from their goals. Too quick motion on your interface can trigger vestibular disorders. Vestibular (inner ear) disorder reactions include dizziness, nausea and headaches.</p>
        <p>A great way to make your media files more accessible is to create captions for video. Closed captions are <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/01/closed-captions-subtitles-ux/">better for everybody</a> and make
          video and audio files more accessible for wider audience. Having multiple chanels for information transfer enhances accessability.</p>

Formulate your content as if it would be a natural conversation with your users and ask yourself what would be appropriate. </p>
        <p> It is important to treat the text as an important part of your interface. The text should be as understandable
