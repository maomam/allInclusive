              people
              who experience stress and axiety as a result of trauma. The principles are based on findings from the
              field of
              trauma informed physical spaces and my empiric observations during helping refugees. </p>
            <p class="introText">Trauma informed design promotes safety, healing, and wellbeing by integrating the
              principles
              of trauma informed care into the design and construction of the spaces where care takes place.</p>
            <p class="introText">My goal was to transform these findings and formulate the principles for the digital

        <p class="subtitle">While accessibility is a big topic in design, it is often understood in terms of insuring
          the physical accessibility or removing the existing barriers to make the products available to the wide range
          of users. My goal was to research the ways to make digital products more accessible to people who experience stress and anxiety as a result of trauma. 
          The research showed that there is way more studies and sources in the
          domain of architecture and interior design then from the field of human-computer interaction. This platform is
          intended to share experience, gather knowledge and provide practical examples in trauma-informed design in the digital world.</p>

        <h2>Natural and cool colors </h2>
        <p> Colors communicate certain mood and affect emotions of users. Longer-wavelength colors
          like red are experienced as arousing, and shorter-wavelength colors like green are experienced as calming.  Light, cool and less
          saturated colors can be used to create a calming, safe and open feeling. Deeply hued warm colors may arouse negative emotions. Also cinsider <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/"> culture-specific </a> associations.</p>
        <p> An important aspect about color choice is the <a

        <h2>Power and control</h2>
        <p> The usage of digital products can provoke an overwhelming sense of powerlessness, especially
          users experiencing stress and anxiety. The usage of <a
            href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">dark
            patterns</a> in design (techniques to manipulate users into making actions
          against their will) facilitates the feeling of having no control.</p>
          <p> One of these techniques contributing to anxiety is the sence of fake urgency
          Timeouts, time counters or an artificial sence of scarcity and urgency for performing actions can
          cause a lot of unease and axiety. The movement for <a href=" 
          https://caseorganic.medium.com/is-your-product-designed-to-be-calm-cdde5039cca5"> "calm technology"</a> is advocating for respect to the user's attention. Some types of deceptive pattern

        <h2>Font legibility</h2>
        <p>Please consider legibility as the main factor while
          choosing typefaces. Legibility and clarity is definetely <a href="https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-ui-typeface-goes-unnoticed"> more important </a> then personality or creativity. </p>
        <p>There are a lot of <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2015/03/typefaces-for-dyslexia.html"> studies </a> about using special fonts designed for people with dyslexia. The conclusion should be made that
          custom fonts themselves are considered not helpful. Still, many effort were made to create a typeface focusing on letterform distinction to increase character recognition for low-vision users.</p>
        <p>Althouth a legible font contributes to comprehension, other typograhic means such as <a href="https://medium.com/@nitishkmrk/legibility-in-user-interfaces-2e6b26db1c26">layout, balance, hierarchy and structure </a> are considered to contribute to
          reading speed or accuracy more.

Use empowering and positive language. Show your users that you belive that they are able to succed in using your product. It is important to set expectations and be transparent about the function of your product from the beginning and provide indication of progress. Explain why certain data is collected and only request information you absolutely need to reduce anxiety about having to reveal too much.

        <p> Special care should be taken while writing error messages. Prepare for both system failure and human error, and respond with the same level of clarity. In case of a human error, provide clear instructions for the options and next steps.

        <h2>Accessible media files </h2>
        <p> Put the user in control when you use animation, audio or video. Autoplay videos and audios prevent users from making a conscious choice. A better alternative is to require an
          explicit action to put users in control and prevent harmful binge watching.
          Users may feel very unease or distracted when experiencing sudden sound or movement. Too quick motion can trigger vestibular (inner ear) disorders like dizziness, nausea and headaches.</p>
        <p>A great way to make your media files more accessible is to create captions for video. Closed captions are <a
